# EvilCube-Unreal
 My first Unreal Engine Game creation.
 This project shows that I have the basic knowledge of developing and compiling a game in Unreal Engine.
 This is a useful project as my skills are shown, this is my first project with many to come.
 There's so much room for growth so I will be able to continue developing my skills.
 Anyone can get started by simply researching the overall goal, learn the language and watch tutorials if you get stuck.
 If you need help with my project feel free to visit my portfolio tholmes18.github.io and click the contact button.
 I will be able to see your questions as well as respond.
 I created this project on my own.
